# Computational-Theory
This repository contains a Python implementation of a solver for the Countdown game, a popular quiz program on British television. The solver aims to find arithmetic expressions that satisfy certain constraints, given a set of source numbers and a target number.

## Installation
To use the Countdown algorithm solver, Python interpreter must be installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website.
